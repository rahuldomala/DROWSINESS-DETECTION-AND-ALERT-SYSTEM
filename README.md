# DROWSINESS-DETECTION-AND-ALERT-SYSTEM
Drowsiness and Fatigue of drivers are among the significant causes of road accidents. Every year, they increase the amounts of deaths and fatalities injuries globally.Therefore, there is a need to develop the systems that will detect and notify a driver of her/him bad psychophysical condition, which could significantly reduce the number of fatigue-related car accidents. However, the development of such systems encounters many difficulties related to fast and proper recognition of a driverâ€™s fatigue symptoms. One of the technical possibilities to implement driver drowsiness detection systems is to use the vision-based approach.
